If you've been scanning headlines in recent days, you're probably convinced that the plunge in oil prices will result in the death of the energy industry as we know it.
True, the Energy Select SPDR ETF has tumbled 8% in less than a week. And when I reached out to Kim Forrest of Fort Pitt Capital asking whether energy is a good buy right now, she responded by telling me "never, ever try to catch a falling knife".
But Tom Kloza, an analyst with the Oil Price Information Service, said many shale companies can continue to be profitable as long as oil stays above $40-50 per barrrel (it's currently at $68). Production will continue to grow, even if at a more moderate pace, he claimed.
"A year from now we're going to be producing more oil than right now, I'm confident of that," said Kloza. 
But there's also a chance that a wave of consolidation will put the industry on stronger.
