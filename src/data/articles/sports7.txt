Serena Williams slammed Russian tennis chief Shamil Tarpischev for his "insensitive, sexist and racist" remarks in describing her and sister Venus as the "Williams brothers" on a late night TV chat show.
The world number one gave her first public reaction Sunday to Tarpischev's comments as she spoke to reporters on the eve of the WTA Tour Finals in Singapore. Tarpischev, who has been banned by the WTA for a year and fined $25,000, has also made a public apology, but that has clearly not satisfied 18-time grand slam champion Williams. "I think the WTA did a great job of taking initiative and taking immediate action to his comments. I thought they were very insensitive and extremely sexist as well as racist at the same time," she said.
