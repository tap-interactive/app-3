A freak injury while playing an impromptu game of football with his teammates could sideline Norwegian skiing great Aksel Lund Svindal for the entire World Cup season.
The five-time world champion was training in Soelden in Austria ahead of the opening races at that ski resort next week when he tore his Achilles tendon. Svindal described on his official Facebook page what had happened. "I was out for a little run with the rest of the team... We ended the session playing around with a ball. Just holding it up in the air between us. "Suddenly I felt something snap in my leg and I knew right away that something was wrong." Svindal, a two-time overall World Cup champion, was rushed to hospital in Innsbruck, and underwent surgery straight away. 
Extremely bad timing just as the season is about to start.
