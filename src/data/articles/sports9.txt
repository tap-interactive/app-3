"The Dominator." With a nickname like that, it’s clear that many people have lofty expectations for Dominik Thiem. 
Born in Wiener Neustadt in Austria on 3 September, 1993, Thiem had tennis in his life from a young age, with both his parents avid players and coaches. Combine that sort of upbringing with his physical gifts, natural talent and formidable ground strokes, it was only a matter of time before he started making an impact on the professional circuit.  
In a recent press conference, Thomas Muster assessed his young countryman’s prospects. "One thing is important, will he be to be able to handle the pressure the public will put on him? In Austria, there is this problem, there are too many expectations. But with him, we have a player who could progress to the top of the rankings. He has yet to achieve important results, but has all the potential to make it."
