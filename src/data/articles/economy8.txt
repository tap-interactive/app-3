India's economic growth slowed last quarter, raising the stakes for Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he seeks to push through long-overdue reforms.
Gross domestic product grew by 5.3% during the second quarter of India's fiscal year, down from a 5.7% expansion in the previous quarter. However, many economists had expected a worse showing. India's new government has gone to great lengths to build a consensus around economic reforms since gaining power in May's parliamentary elections. Modi has promised to end policy paralysis, reduce inflation and tackle corruption. He also pledged to establish manufacturing hubs and industrial corridors and improve the tax code. But many of the reforms have been stalled by political gridlock, and big ticket reforms have failed to materialize.
