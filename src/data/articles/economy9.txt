Get ready for a midterm election after-party on Wall Street. If history is any guide, stocks are about to rise a lot.
U.S. stocks have gone up substantially during the six months following the past 13 midterm elections. If that perfect track record isn't compelling enough for you, the average S&P 500 rally during those six-month stretches was an impressive 16.5%, according to BTIG. That crushes the average November to April gain of just 3.7% in all other years. "After midterms, you often get deals that investors view favorably. Ultimately, you end up with higher stock prices," said Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG.
Just because stocks performed a certain way in the past doesn't mean it will be the same way this time around. It's also important to remember, as Greenhaus notes, that the data BTIG is using only goes back to 1964.
