It's plain sailing so far on Wednesday. Here are the five things you need to know before the opening bell rings in New York.
1. Earnings and economics: U.S. stock futures where little changed as investors looked ahead to a batch of fresh economic data ad company earnings.
2. Stock market movers: Shares in a auto supplier Takata fell more than 7% in Tokyo following pressure from the U.S. government to widen the recall of exploding airbags made by the Japanese firm.
3. International markets overview: European markets where little changed in early trading. Asian markets ended mostly lower, led by a 0.7% decline in Hong Kong.
4. China disconnect: The Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect -- which allows international investors to buy stocks in Shanghai-- continued to falter in its third day of operation.

5. Japan: Fresh from its shock Halloween stimulus gambit, the Bank of Japan said it will maintain current policy for now.
