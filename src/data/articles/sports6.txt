Given Real Madrid is listed by Forbes as the world's most valuable sports team, perhaps it's understandable there is a tinge of hyperbole in the marketing of the redevelopment of Real Madrid's home.
"We were inspired by medieval cathedrals, with all their sculptures and paintings around the building telling their stories," Volkwin Marg, who heads up the German architectural firm Gerkan, Marg and Partners that designed the new arena, told CNN. When its proposed refurbishment ends in around six years' time, the Bernabeu -- where Real beat great rivals Barcelona on Saturday -- will be wrapped in a skin of LEDs and 'polished mirror.'
Housing a retail area, restaurants and hotel among the attractions under its metallic membrane, the multipurpose arena will transform a stadium where construction began 70 years ago today. Its new exterior will also be able to beam out the most famous moments of the 10-time European champions upon completion.
