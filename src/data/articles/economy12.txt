Whole Foods, the leading organic grocery chain, with 388 stores in North America and the United Kingdom, reported tepid sales growth and a cautious outlook for the next quarter late Wednesday.
Shares of Whole Foods (WFM) sank more 3% on Thursday on the news. The stock is now down 35% this year, making it one of the worst performers in the S&P 500. Whole Foods said comparable store sales increased just 3.9% in its most recent quarter. That's far below Whole Food's long-term target of 6% growth. The Austin-based company has been at the forefront of the shift in Americans' eating habits towards organic produce, dairy products from grass-fed cows and non-genetically modified proteins. But as demand for high quality food has increased, so have the number of specialty stores seeking to cash in on the trend.
Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), which went public in 2013, and The Fresh Market (TFM) both compete directly with Whole Foods.
