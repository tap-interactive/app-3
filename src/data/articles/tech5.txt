We might still not have jetpacks and flying cars, but another dangling promise of the technology world now seems one step closer. Virtual reality (VR) is a serious business. 
As confirmed byFacebook's acquisition of Oculus VR for $2 billion earlier this year. Now, the makers of the highly anticipated Oculus device seem on track to deliver a consumer model, which they say is "many months," but not years, away. "This is the beginning of consumer virtual reality," said Brendan Iribe, CEO of Oculus VR, referring to the company's latest prototype, called "Crescent Bay."
Faster, lighter and equipped with headphones, the prototype offers the best performance to date, says Iribe, and a convincing peek into the world of virtual reality. "It has very low latency, so when you're moving around it's not catching up with you, it's all happening instantaneously," Iribe told CNN, from the Web Summit technology conference, in Dublin.
