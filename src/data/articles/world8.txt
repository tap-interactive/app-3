A U.N. official has a message for those worried about chemical weapons in Syria: A plan is in motion to do something about them. 
The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is in the capital of Damascus this week to sort out the plan for the destruction of 12 facilities used to make chemical weapons, Sigrid Kaag said Wednesday. Kaag, the special adviser overseeing the destruction of Syria's chemical stockpiles, addressed the Security Council on Wednesday, according to Gary Quinlan, the Australian ambassador to the United Nations and head of the council. He relayed that plans to destroy seven hangers and five underground tunnels are to start later this month and are to be completed in the summer of 2015. 
The OPCW team is also in consultations to draw up plans for the destruction of chemical weapons facilities.
