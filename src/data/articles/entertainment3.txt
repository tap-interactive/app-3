Taylor Swift may be breaking records in the music industry, but Beyonce is breaking the bank.
The superstar singer has for the second year in a row topped Forbes' list of the top-earning women in music. The artist known as Beyonce Knowles Carter slid into the No. 1 slot last year with $53 million in earnings; she more than doubled that in 2014 by earning $115 million.

"Beyonce played 95 shows during our scoring period, bringing in an average $2.4 million per city," Forbes reports. "She added endorsement deals from the likes of H&M and Pepsi -- plus her self-titled surprise album, which hit iTunes in December 2013 and quickly became one of the year's top sellers -- to send her income into nine-figure territory."
