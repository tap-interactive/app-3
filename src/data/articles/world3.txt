Arnold Abbott handed out four plates of food to homeless people in a South Florida park. Then police stopped the 90-year-old from serving up another bite. 
"An officer said, 'Drop that plate right now -- like I had a weapon,'" Abbott said. Abbott and two pastors in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, were charged for feeding the homeless in public on Sunday, the city's first crackdowns under a new ordinance banning public food sharing, CNN affiliate WPLG reported. Now they face possible jail time and a $500 fine, WPLG said. Despite some criticism from homeless advocates, city officials have vowed the new rules will be enforced. 
"Just because of media attention we don't stop enforcing the law. We enforce the laws here in Fort Lauderdale," Mayor Jack Seiler told WPLG. He defended the law in an interview with the Sun-Sentinel newspaper. "I'm not satisfied with having a cycle of homeless in the city of Fort Lauderdale," Seiler said.
