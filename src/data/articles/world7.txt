Airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS targeted the Islamist rebel group Ahrar al Sham for the first time overnight in Syria, a monitoring group said Thursday. 
One airstrike hit the headquarters for Ahrar al Sham in Babsaqa, Idlib province, near the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Activist video and photos from the scene claimed to show a large explosion and a building blown into rubble. Ahrar al Sham is a Sunni Muslim group that is not on the U.S. list of designated terrorist organizations and so far has not been hit by coalition airstrikes. 
One of the more conservative Sunni militant groups in the rebel alliance, Ahrar al Sham has members that fight alongside the al Qaeda-affiliated Islamist militant group Jabhat al-Nusra, but against ISIS. They are not linked to al Qaeda, have not pledged allegiance to al Qaeda, and are not named as a terror group by the US.
