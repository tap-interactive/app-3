Time Warner, the parent company of CNN, impressed investors on Wednesday by beating Wall Street expectations and upping its profit forecast for the year.
The company's stock closed up about 4% for the day, at $77.99. New revenue from video-on-demand and elsewhere offset a weak summer film slate from its Warner Bros. division. Revenue grew 3% to $2.8 billion. At its cable channel division Turner, per-subscriber fees made up for weak advertising sales. Revenue there was up 5% to $2.4 billion. At HBO, revenue rose 10%, to $1.3 billion, also largely thanks to increases in per-subscriber fees. HBO recently announced that it will start to sell a version of its service via the Internet next year.
Overall revenue at the company rose 3%. Earnings per share of $1.11 exceeded analysts' projections of 94 cents per share.
