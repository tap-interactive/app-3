A skier following the fall line will reach the maximum possible speed for that slope. A skier with skis pointed perpendicular to the fall line, across the hill instead of down it. 
The speed of descent down any given hill can be controlled.You can change the angle of motion in relation to the fall line, skiing across the hill rather than down it. However, ski runs are generally of finite width and a skier using this technique to slow down it will eventually move sideways to the edge of the run. At this point the skier must turn around to continue the descent in another direction. In theory, a run down the hill would consist of straight sections across the hill. They have to be sharp turns to the complementary angle, as if the skier is being reflected from the edges of the run.Downhill skiing technique focuses on the use of turns to smoothly turn the skis from one direction to another.
