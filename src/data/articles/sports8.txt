In an era of Spanish clay kings, Thomas Muster was pre-eminent. At his dominant best from the baseline.
the barrel-chested Austrian harnessed tremendous balance off both wings to wear down his rivals with heavy topspin body blows. He ranks as one of the best clay-courters of all time. On 1 April 1989, in his fifth season as a pro, Muster found himself in hospital, just two hours after he had just come back from two sets down to beat World No. 13 Yannick Noah to reach the Miami final. His career had been on an upward trajectory, until he was the victim of a drunk driver – 37-year-old Norman Sobie – who had severed cruciate and side ligaments in his left knee. 
Muster flew back to Vienna for surgery, thinking he would make a quick recovery. Doctors weren’t so sure. The 22 year old started training almost immediately.
